# InOutTennis
Allows tracking a tennis ball in a video and determining whether the ball is 'in' or 'out.' The lines are determined by the user by placing points at the ends of the court.

You can choose any video you like, but you need to take a screenshot of it to create the rectangle. 

If you have any questions, you can contact me at simonxcv@hotmail.com :)
